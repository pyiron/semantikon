You would like to combine them to give ontological information to your data, but it is just too much of an effort to understand the structure of the ontology and integrate it into your workflow. `semantikon` gives you a simple tool to easily annotate your workflow nodes with ontological information."

In other words, you can dye clothes whether they have been washed before or not, which also applies to washing.
